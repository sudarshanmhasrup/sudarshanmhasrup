### Introduction 👋

Hi! I’m Sudarshan, a software developer from India who fell in love with Kotlin and enjoys building cross-platform and
native software solutions with `Kotlin` and `Kotlin Multiplatform`. What began as curiosity about software development
has grown into my passion. I love writing, testing, debugging, and deploying code that solves real-world problems.

I’ve dedicated myself to developing native and cross-platform software solutions, using `Kotlin Multiplatform` and
`Compose Multiplatform` to focus on Android, iOS, desktop, and web from a single codebase.

### Open Source

I love contributing to open-source projects and creating my own. Here are some of the open-source projects I’ve created:

- [Localina](https://github.com/sudarshanmhasrup/localina): A Kotlin Multiplatform library that supports real-time
  locale updates in your Compose Multiplatform app. I created this library to make it easier to work with Compose
  Multiplatform and handle locale changes seamlessly.
