### Introduction ðŸ‘‹

Hi! Iâ€™m Sudarshan, a software developer from India who fell in love with Kotlin and enjoys building cross-platform and
native software solutions with `Kotlin` and `Kotlin Multiplatform`. What began as curiosity about software development
has grown into my passion. I love writing, testing, debugging, and deploying code that solves real-world problems.

Iâ€™ve dedicated myself to developing native and cross-platform software solutions, using `Kotlin Multiplatform` and
`Compose Multiplatform` to focus on Android, iOS, desktop, and web from a single codebase.

### Open Source

I love contributing to open-source projects and creating my own. Here are some of the open-source projects Iâ€™ve created:

- [Localina](https://github.com/sudarshanmhasrup/localina): A Kotlin Multiplatform library that supports real-time
  locale updates in your Compose Multiplatform app. I created this library to make it easier to work with Compose
  Multiplatform and handle locale changes seamlessly.

Do you want to know the technology stack I use for writing and developing software? Donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™ve got you covered.
Hereâ€™s the list of technologies I use in my daily developer life.

#### Mobile App Development

Here are the technologies I use to build cross-platform and native mobile apps.
